# Swimming pool detection with Azure Custom Vision

This is an Azure Custom Vision demo to detect swimming pool from aerial images.

We can directly import an existing labelled dataset of images from the kaggle website into an Azure Custom Vision project using PyLabel (no need to do the labelling task).
Then we will train an object detection model using the nocode interface of Azure Custom Vision.
We can use some python code to call the Azure Custom vision deployed model to display the results.
